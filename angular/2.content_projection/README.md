# Content Projection

`<ng-content>` can be used as a placeholder to display dynamic markup in a component.

`ng-content` offers the following selectors

* CSS selectors
* tag selectors

When `<ng-content>` is available without any selector specified, all the elements which do not match any other selector get projected here.
